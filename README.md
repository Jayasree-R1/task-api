I executed the given problem statement end-to-end during the interview and demonstrated the API outputs live. I have retained a snapshot of the execution with timestamps, should it be helpful for reference.

Following the execution, during the code review, the interviewer verified all the API endpoints (I used postman) specified in the problem statement, including:

POST /tasks – create

GET /tasks – read all

GET /tasks/:id – read by ID

PUT /tasks/:id – update

DELETE /tasks/:id – delete

I was then asked to explain the code in detail, including the folder structure, the overall Node.js server architecture workflow, the call stack execution starting from app.js, and core runtime concepts such as callbacks, the event loop, Promises, and async execution — all of which I explained during the session.

In the managerial round, the discussion was largely conversational. We spoke about the difficulty level of the coding round, my project experience, my IEEE publications, and my 5 years of background in the healthcare domain.
