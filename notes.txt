Built a RESTful API using Node.js and Express

Used Express Router to define endpoints and keep routing modular

Implemented CRUD operations for tasks:

POST /tasks – create

GET /tasks – read all

GET /tasks/:id – read by id

PUT /tasks/:id – update

DELETE /tasks/:id – delete

Data model includes:

id (UUID v4 for global uniqueness)

title (required)

description (optional)

status (pending | in-progress | completed)

createdAt (ISO timestamp)

Used in-memory storage (array) managed in the service layer

Applied async/await everywhere to follow non-blocking I/O patterns

Implemented input validation:

Title must be present and non-empty

Status must be from an allowed enum

Centralized business logic in services (no logic in routes)

Controllers handle only HTTP concerns (req → service → res)

Added centralized error-handling middleware:

Converts thrown errors into consistent JSON responses

Maps errors to correct HTTP status codes (400, 404, 201, 204, 500)

Used proper REST status codes:

201 Created

200 OK

204 No Content

400 Bad Request

404 Not Found
